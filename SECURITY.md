# Security Policy

## About This Project

This is a hobby project that I'm working on for fun and learning. While I don't expect many people to use it, I still want to handle any security issues responsibly if they come up.

## Found a Security Issue?

If you find something that looks like a security problem, here's what you can do:

### How to Let Me Know

1. **Please don't create a public issue** - I'd rather fix it quietly first
2. **Send me a message** through:
   - GitHub: Open an issue and mention it's security-related, or
   - Email: Drop me a line
